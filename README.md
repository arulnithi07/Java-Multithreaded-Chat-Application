ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
To build a multithreaded Java-based client-server chat application where multiple clients can communicate with each other in real-time using sockets and threads. This project emphasizes real-time communication, concurrency, and network programming concepts.

ðŸ“˜ Project Overview:
This Java console-based chat system consists of:

Server: Accepts multiple client connections using ServerSocket and handles each client in a separate thread.

Client: Connects to the server, sends messages, and receives messages from other connected clients in real-time.

Key Features:

Handles multiple clients simultaneously using threads

Broadcasts messages from one client to all others

Supports client joining, messaging, and leaving notifications

ðŸ§© How It Works:
Start the server using ChatServer.java

Launch multiple clients using ChatClient.java

Each client enters their username and starts chatting

Server handles all messages and distributes them to all connected clients
